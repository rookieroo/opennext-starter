  - Server state with React Server @/components/commerce
  - Client state with Zustand where needed
  - URL state with NUQS
- Cloudflare bindings accessed through getCloudflareContext

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests (Vitest)
- Integration tests
- E2E tests (Playwright)
- Performance testing

### Documentation
- API documentation
- User guides
- Developer documentation
- Architecture diagrams

### Database Schema

  - CUID2 based IDs
  - Timestamps (created/updated)
  - Basic user fields (firstName, lastName, email)
  - Password hash storage
  - Authentication provider fields
  - Settings fields with validation
  - Profile information fields
  - Email verification status
- Session storage in KV with:
  - User relationship
  - Expiration tracking
  - Secure session management
  - Auto-cleanup via KV TTL
  - Rate limiting data
- Authentication features:
  - Email/password authentication
  - Session-based auth with KV storage
  - Secure password hashing
  - Sign-in/Sign-up flows
